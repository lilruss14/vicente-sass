        <h1>Meet the Band</h1>
        <h3>Glenn Frey</h3>
        <p>
          Frey is a founding member of the band back in its conception in the 1970's and has always been a member. A proud son of Michigan, Frey took off to stardom with his smooth voice and his ability to compose most of the bands songs. Frey managed to play the keyboard and guitar while also taking on the job of co-lead singer. 
        </p>
        <h3>Don Henley</h3>
        <p>
          Henley was just a Texas kid with a dream to break into the music industry. That dream became a reality when Henley met Frey and a friendship was born that turned into the creation of the band. Henley primarily plays drums for the band while also being a co-lead singer and guitarist. Henley's ability to play his heart on the drums while also singing has made him a staple for generations in the music industry. 
        </p>
        <h3>Timothy B. Schmit</h3>
        <p>
          Schmit was not apart of the bands conception in the 1970's but joined later on after having already built a career of being a bass guitar player. The only member of the band to be from California, Scmit brought the California cool to an already stacked band. Schmit left the band after a few years but returned in the 1990's. "Love Will Keep Us Alive" and "I Can't Tell You Why" are some of his most popular songs because he is the lead voaclist.
